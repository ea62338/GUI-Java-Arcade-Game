# GUI-Java-Arcade-Game

## App Description

>This application is a javafx game that is modeled after the classic arcade game DonkeyKong
>Users are able to move using the left and right keys, and jump using the space bar, they are also able to use the up key to move up ladders
>The goal is to avoid the moving barrels on each floor by jumping and getting to the ladders to climb up and reach pauline at the top
> If they hit a barrel they die and are prompted with a play again message. but if they reach the top they win and are able to play again.
>I learned a lot about game mechanics and how things work with each other.
